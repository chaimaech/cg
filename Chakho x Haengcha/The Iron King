# **THE KING: THE BENEFACTOR WHO BECAME A BUTCHER**

## **I. His Starting Point — A Well-Meaning Prince with a Vision**

When he was young, Hanyang faced:

* Ki instability after the Water Guardian’s natural death
* declining harvests
* failing machinery
* growing poverty in rural regions
* political pressure from noble clans who feared losing power to industry
* unrest in districts where Ki became turbulent or thin

As crown prince, he truly **wanted to help**:

* restore Ki balance
* stabilize the capital
* modernize the country to prevent famine and decline
* bring prosperity to both the city and the rural provinces

He was educated in engineering, governance, and metaphysics, and saw the world through a pragmatic, problem-solving lens.

### **His early belief:**

“Spirits are unreliable allies. Machines are consistent. Technology will save us.”

He didn’t hate spirits—he simply saw them as:

* unpredictable
* emotionally driven
* fragile
* too deeply tied to natural cycles to be scalable

He genuinely believed that **no country could rely on beings that might disappear for decades, refuse help based on mood, or die without warning**.

# **II. His Superiority Complex Toward Spirits — How It Formed**

This bias didn’t come from malice but from **his education and personal experiences**:

### **1. Court culture taught him humans were “civilization,” spirits were “wild nature.”**

Classic “cultivated vs uncultivated” ideology.

### **2. He studied spirits academically, not personally.**

He learned about Ki patterns, bead structures, energy resonance—
not their personalities, communities, or emotional lives.
To him, a spirit was a phenomenon, not a person.

### **3. As a teen, several spirits refused long-term contracts with the palace.**

He interpreted it as spirits being:

* capricious
* unreliable
* selfish

He concluded:
“How can we build a nation on beings like this?”

### **4. Early advisors reinforced the idea**

Older ministers feared relying on spirits.
They told him humans must become self-sufficient.

This hardwired his belief that humans were:

* logical
* goal-driven
* stable
* the rightful custodians of Ki

…while spirits were merely “living manifestations of energy.”

# **III. His Breaking Point — The Water Crisis**

When the River Guardian Spirit died naturally:

* Ki currents collapsed across the capital
* machines malfunctioned
* floods and droughts alternated unpredictably
* unrest increased
* rural clans demanded action
* a food shortage loomed

And the prince saw, in real time:
**“The death of one spirit can endanger millions of people.”**

This confirmed his worldview.

### **He wasn’t angry. He was disappointed.**

Disappointed that spirits could die so easily.
Disappointed that humans had no power to prevent it.
Disappointed that Ki ecology was fragile.

He concluded:
“To protect the living, we must stop depending on spirits.”

# **IV. The First Step Toward Darkness — Harvesting “Already Dying” Spirits**

When scholars suggested harvesting bead fragments to stabilize Hanyang, he **refused to kill** initially.

He only approved:

* harvesting spirits already fading
* collecting fragments left behind
* “helping” unstable spirits disperse peacefully

He saw it as mercy.

But then he discovered something:

### **Fragments from dying spirits could stabilize entire districts.**

Factories ran safely.
People stopped getting sick from Ki turbulence.
Spirit ferality decreased.
Food production recovered.

He concluded:
“This is a blessing. We must expand it.”

And that’s where he stepped onto the slope.

# **V. The Shift — Justifying Killing for the Greater Good**

When natural fragment supply dwindled, he faced a choice:

* let Hanyang decline
* or take fragments by force

He convinced himself:

### **“Spirits don’t truly die—they return to Ki.

What matters is human prosperity.”**

His reasoning:

* Spirits reincarnate or reform eventually
* Humans suffer in the meantime
* He has a moral duty to protect the living
* A few sacrifices can save millions
* As king, he alone sees the entire picture
* Spirits don’t feel pain the way humans do (false, but he believes it)
* Spirits don’t build civilizations—humans do

His final mental leap:
**"If spirits are part of nature, then what I do is no different than harvesting trees or fish. Necessary, not cruel."**

---

# **VI. His Current Mindset — A Monster Who Thinks He’s a Saviour**

He fully believes:

* he is the only one strong enough to make hard decisions
* history will vindicate him
* critics are ignorant or naive
* spirits are resources, not people
* industrialization must accelerate for the nation’s survival

He views opposition as:

* dangerously sentimental
* manipulated by spirits
* standing in the way of progress

### **He doesn’t think he’s evil.

He thinks you simply don’t understand what must be done.**

To him, he’s:

* The protector
* The reformer
* The necessary villain of a brighter future
* The father whose children (the kingdom) hate him but will thank him later

---

# **VII. What Makes Him a Truly Great Antagonist**

He is terrifying not because of cruelty but because of conviction.

He is:

* rational
* articulate
* morally consistent (within his worldview)
* unbothered by killing spirits because he truly sees it as **resource management**
* proud of helping humans become independent from Ki beings
* confident that history will see him as a hero

He might even have moments of compassion for people.

But never for spirits.

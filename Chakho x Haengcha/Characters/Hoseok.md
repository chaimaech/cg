# 🌫 HIS HALF-SPIRIT NATURE (and what it means)

## **1. His Memory Is Quiet, Not Photographic (Very Important)**

He does **not** have perfect recall.
Instead, he has:

* an uncanny sense for **when something “should” happen**,
* perfect **situational awareness**,
* a natural feel for **trajectory, timing, and consequences**,
* a gentle, lingering sensitivity to **emotions left in places**.

This comes from his mother, who was a **Spirit of a Forgotten Battlefield**, a Ki-echo of thousands of unburied regrets.

### He remembers:

* emotional tones,
* atmospheres,
* patterns of violence,
* subtle shifts in Ki…

Because memory is **part of his blood**, not sharp visuals.

This makes his accuracy supernaturally intuitive.

---

## **2. Why He Never Forgets Feelings (but Forget Facts)**

The battlefield spirit did not store *images* — it stored *emotions*, *intent*, and the “shape” of events.

So Hoseok:

* remembers sounds and impressions more than faces,
* remembers the *weight* of moments more than the details,
* recalls how fear or loss felt, even decades later.

This makes **emotional cues** extremely potent triggers for him.

It’s why he has nightmares.
It’s why he hates how easily he “feels” things.

---

## **3. His Spirit Traits**

* can sense Ki “currents” like wind patterns
* perceives the emotional residue in places
* instinctively knows **where** an arrow must land to achieve an intent
* can draw Ki-made arrows endlessly once he awakens
* experiences dissociation or dizziness in places of mass trauma (because they feel like home)

# 💔 HIS CHILDHOOD

## **Age 0–4: Love, fear, and loss**

He remembers:

* a house that was too quiet,
* a father’s hands that were always warm,
* a mother who hummed when she was anxious,
* the sound of wind passing through tall grass like whispers.

He does **not** remember faces clearly.
But he remembers emotions in painful detail.

At age 4:

* his mother carried him far from the battlefield
* left him at a small border-town temple
* whispered a promise he didn’t understand:

> “Be more than sorrow. Live.”

He saw her silhouette fade,
like smoke being swallowed by wind.

He never saw her again.

He knows she returned to die.
He understands that now.
He hates that he understands.

---

## **Age 4–12: The Temple Years**

He learns silence first.
He learns to avoid questions second.
He learns to hide third.

Monks think he’s strange:

* too calm
* too perceptive
* too aware of danger
* too “sad” for a child his age

He practices archery because:

* the bow is quiet
* arrows don’t require words
* hitting a target feels like controlling fate

---

## **Age 13–27: Becoming a Chakho Grey Tiger**

He enlists early.
He rises quickly.

Why?
Because his instincts are terrifyingly perfect.

He becomes “the never-missing archer.”

He hides his spirit nature so thoroughly that **even he starts believing his own excuses**.

He tells himself:

* he is human
* spirits are dangerous
* his mother was a mistake
* he must erase spirits to erase the part of him that is wrong

But this denial slowly breaks him inside.

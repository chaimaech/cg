# **I. ORIGINS**

### **Birth & Family**

* Born to the **gumiho gisaeng house master**, a centuries-old fox who disguised herself as human to survive the era of bead-harvesting.
* Jimin was biologically male, which meant he would have been taken away and enslaved to a noble household.
* To prevent this, his mother altered his **Ki signature in infancy**, weaving a glamour so stable it became his default appearance: a delicate girl with soft, fox-like eyes.

### **Early Life**

* Raised among gisaeng as a daughter: trained in dance, singing, etiquette, card games, ink painting.
* Never allowed to leave the house alone, not out of cruelty but fear — the spell over his identity was delicate, and revealing his fox heritage could lead to execution.

### **Neighborhood Childhood Friends**

* **Yoongi** — the blind street sweeper prince. Jimin adored him for always speaking to him as “you” without assuming a gender.
* **Jin** — the servant child; Jimin’s co-conspirator and emotional stabilizer.
* **Taehyung** — a spirit disguised as a neighborhood boy; the only one who could instinctively sense Jimin’s fox core even before Jimin understood it.

# **II. PERSONALITY**

### **Surface Persona**

* Charming, flirtatious, playful.
* Naturally theatrical; years of gisaeng training give them perfect posture, controlled breath, soft voice, and deadly grace.
* Reads a room instantly and adjusts identity to match it — femme, androgynous, coquettish, serene… whatever keeps him safe.

### **Inner Jimin**

* Soft-hearted but sharp-tongued.
* Deeply empathetic toward anyone trapped by birth or circumstance.
* Hates lies but is built out of them.
* Terrified of abandonment; clings fiercely to the trio.
* Gender expression shifts with Ki state:

  * **Human Ki high → more masculine**
  * **Fox Core active → more feminine**
  * **Balanced → androgynous and ethereal**

### **Core Traits**

* Loyal to a fault
* Emotionally intelligent
* Skilled at manipulation but uses it to protect others
* Easily jealous
* Slow to trust strangers
* Quick to laugh but quicker to hide pain behind it

# **III. APPEARANCE**

### **Human Form**

* Soft round face, fox-like eyes, small mouth.
* Hair worn long; often decorated with flowers or ribbon sleeves.
* Movements are fluid—even casual gestures feel choreographed.

### **True Form (Jimin)**

* Inhumanly light on his feet.
* Silver-tipped hair; pupils shift into thin fox slits when emotions spike.
* Illusory tails flicker behind him when he’s tired or upset (visible only to those attuned to Ki).

### **Fox Form**

* A small, elegant white fox with nine faintly visible Ki strands instead of full tails — incomplete due to his suppressed core.

# **IV. KI & ABILITIES**

### **1. **Glamour Ki (Primary Ability)**

The Ki his mother embedded into him at birth enables him to:

* Maintain a full-body gender presentation illusion
* Mask his scent and spirit signature
* Adjust voice, height, or facial softness subtly
* Appear harmless even when he is not

Over the years, he has mastered his glamour so well that even skilled Ki readers mistake him for human.

### **2. **Emotion-Weaving**

He can project soft emotional currents:

* calm
* mild attraction
* trust
* melancholy

These emotions are not mind-control but nudges, like a warm breeze altering someone’s mood.

### **3. **Illusory Echoes**

He can duplicate brief images, sounds, or afterimages of himself — used to evade or distract opponents.

### **4. **Fox Core (Suppressed)**

When the suppression slips:

* reflexes spike
* nails sharpen into fox claws
* pupils slit and glow
* voice gains resonance
* gender presentation shifts unpredictably
* illusions become instinctive and dangerous

Unlocking his Fox Core fully will be a major arc: it requires accepting himself instead of performing for others.

# **V. RELATIONSHIPS**

### **Yoongi (Blind Prince)**

* Jimin loved him first as a friend, then maybe something deeper.
* Yoongi never cared about Jimin’s gender — only the warmth of his Ki presence, which remained constant beneath all disguises.
* Jimin is fiercely protective of him.

### **Jin (Servant Child)**

* Close confidant; the one he runs to when illusions crack.
* They share the experience of living under someone else’s rules, though Jimin hides this better.
* Jin is the only human who knows the truth of Jimin’s body.

### **Taehyung (Spirit Boy)**

* Kindred creature; their Ki harmonizes naturally.
* Taehyung saw Jimin’s fox nature instantly and thought it was beautiful.
* Their friendship is otherworldly, weird, comforting — the one place Jimin doesn’t need to perform.

### **Mother (Gumiho House Master)**

* Loving but calculating.
* Created Jimin's persona out of desperation, but also out of selfishness — she wanted to keep her child close.
* Their relationship is tender yet strained by secrets.

# **VI. ROLE IN THE STORY**

### **Narrative Functions**

* The trio’s negotiator, spy, and emotional barometer.
* Has access to noble gossip, blackmail, and political undercurrents.
* The key to bridging human and spirit perspectives — his existence literally proves coexistence is possible but dangerous.

### **Personal Arc**

A story about:

* shedding layers of enforced identity
* embracing fluidity as strength rather than disguise
* choosing found family over inherited roles
* unlocking a Fox Core shaped not by hunger but by self-acceptance

When he finally breaks the suppression, his nine tails appear as shimmering Ki strands behind him — symbolizing a new identity crafted by himself, not his mother or society.

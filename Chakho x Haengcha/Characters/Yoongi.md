# **I. ORIGIN**

Born as the first son of the ruling king, Yoongi’s early life was sheltered, gentle, and filled with song—his mother’s lullabies are his last clear memory of light.

At age 7–9, he witnessed the assassination of his family during the Iron King’s coup.
He was injured during the escape: shrapnel and burning debris seared into his face, leaving him blind.

A servant boy his age dragged him through hidden corridors until they collapsed near the river district, where a mysterious gisaeng rescued them both.
She was secretly a **gumiho**, fearing the growing violence toward spirits.

She hid the boys in her house, passing Yoongi off as an orphaned blind servant.

His trauma tore open his Ki channels, permanently altering him.

# **II. APPEARANCE**

* Pale, soft-featured, with faint scars tracing from his temples to below his eyes
* Longish hair tied loosely; strands often fall across his face
* Face is serene, but his posture has tension — like someone always bracing for another shockwave
* Scars around his eyes have softened with age but remain visible, eyes clouded, but strangely luminous—especially when Ki pulses
* Always carries a worn broom made of wood and copper thread (his makeshift Ki-conductor), carefully repaired many times, reinforced along the shaft with metal bands
* Lean, understated, and quietly elegant despite his shabby clothing in muted greys and washed-out blues
* Movements are slow, deliberate, surprisingly graceful for someone blind
* When listening deeply, he tilts his head and breathes as though tasting the air

Yoongi has the unassuming presence of someone who wants to disappear —
but the dignity of someone raised royal still lingers in the slope of his shoulders.

There’s an uncanny stillness about him.
People avoid him without knowing why.

# **III. PERSONALITY**

Quiet, introspective, and soft-spoken — the kind of presence you don’t notice until he speaks.

### **Core Traits**

* Deeply empathetic (to a painful degree)
* Calm but not emotionless — grief sits underneath everything he does
* Avoids conflict, yet becomes unshakable when a line is crossed
* Often lost in internal worlds of sound, vibration, and Ki texture
* Doesn’t believe he is important; he wants to be forgettable

### **Strengths**

* Insightful to the point of unnerving accuracy
* Can read emotional intent better than anyone—almost instinctively
* Able to endure immense pain to protect others
* Thinks several layers beneath what’s spoken

### **Flaws**

* Self-sacrificing to the point of recklessness
* Refuses help because he believes others suffer “cleaner” than he does
* Emotional numbness as a coping mechanism
* Guilt over surviving when his family did not
* Has never fully processed the night of the coup

### **What Age Has Given Him**

* A calm authority that others trust instantly
* The ability to comfort without words
* A quiet courage that isn’t youthful recklessness but lived experience
* A moral compass forged in pain but guided by compassion

# **IV. KI ABILITIES — “ECHO KI”**

Yoongi does not *see* with Ki.

He **feels**.

His Ki pulses outward like ripples, returning with impressions of:

### **1. Physical Space**

Shape, distance, vibration, density
(he perceives the world as shifting pressure maps)

### **2. Living Ki**

He can sense:

* fear
* anger
* dishonesty
* murderous intent
* dying Ki
* spirits hiding in human form

### **3. Pain Resonance**

The most brutal part of his ability:

* When a spirit is killed, he feels the death like a shock through his chest
* Each stolen bead creates a tearing sensation behind his eyes
* Artificial beads cause dissonant, nauseating waves of “wrongness”

### **4. Tracking**

He can follow the “afterecho” of a Ki event:

* crime scenes
* harvested spirits
* corrupted beads
* the Iron King’s experimental machines

### **Limitations**

* Overstimulation can collapse him
* Loud industrial zones overwhelm his Ki map
* Prolonged sensing causes headaches, nosebleeds, or fainting
* He cannot always distinguish between his emotions and others’
* Ki pain can incapacitate him at critical moments

---

# **V. MOTIVATION**

Yoongi’s goal is *not* revenge.
He barely remembers his family’s faces.

What drives him is **compassion sharpened by agony**.

He feels every spirit death in Hanyang.
Every experiment.
Every fragment ripped loose.

The Iron King’s actions physically hurt him.
If he does nothing, the city will drown in Ki distortion.

And he refuses to let anyone—human or spirit—suffer while he stays silent.

---

# **VI. RELATIONSHIPS**

### **1. The Servant Boy (His Savior)**

* The person Yoongi trusts most
* His voice is the first anchor Yoongi ever had in the dark
* Their bond is fierce but unspoken
* The boy carries his own guilt and bitterness from living as a shadow
* Yoongi often feels unworthy of being saved

### **2. The Gumiho Gisaeng**

* His teacher, protector, and mother-figure
* Understands his Ki pain better than any human
* Warned him that his Ki would one day “shake a throne”
* He fears losing her the way he lost his mother

### **3. The Gumiho’s Child (Raised as a Girl)**

* Yoongi’s closest emotional connection
* They grew up together in secrecy and shared fear
* Yoongi respects the child’s dual identity deeply
* They understand each other’s loneliness without speaking

### **4. The Other Protagonists**

Yoongi is the quiet thread holding the group together:

* He hears tensions before they spark
* Feels when someone is lying or hurting
* Notices when someone’s Ki “dims”
  He is the one who senses danger long before anyone else.

# **VII. CHARACTER ARC**

### **Act I — The Silent Witness**

Yoongi endures the pain of spirit deaths alone, sweeping the streets and pretending he is harmless.

### **Act II — The Compass of Suffering**

He learns to track Ki distortions to their source.
He realizes the Iron King’s experiments are accelerating.

He can no longer be passive.

### **Act III — The Unwilling Heir**

His identity as the lost crown prince resurfaces.
He doesn’t want the throne—only to stop the harm.

But the people begin to seek him.
And the Iron King begins to hunt him.

### **Act IV — Confrontation**

When he stands before the Iron King, he feels every bead the tyrant has ever stolen.
The weight of countless deaths presses on him.

He isn’t fueled by rage.

He is fueled by *every cry he ever felt in the dark*.

# **VIII. SIGNATURE MOMENT**

A scene idea that encapsulates him:

> “Another one.”

> Yoongi’s voice is barely a whisper as he grips his broom like a crutch.
> Pain ripples through his Ki—sharp, urgent.
> A spirit somewhere in the city is dying.

> He inhales slowly, gathering strength.
> At twenty-eight, the pain is heavier than it used to be.

> “Hold on,” he murmurs to no one and everyone at once.

> Then he starts walking, steps sure despite the blindness—
> following the echo of death only he can hear.
